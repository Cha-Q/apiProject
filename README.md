# API project

## Introduction to the project

To introduce this project, I need to talk about it's purpose.
In first instance, I wanted to nourrish my github repo wallet and create habits.
Then I found it kind of hard to use API with PHP, and I needed to improve
my knowledge on how things should work out.

## The languages

I will use essentially **PHP** on logic, class creation, in fact, It'll wrap all the project.
But of course, it's a web application so there'll be some **HTML**, for the website
architecture, **bootstrap** to embellish and smooth the design.

## What's coming next

When I'll be happy with the project and how he'll work, I'm planning to do the same with **Javascript** and, if I can learn fast enough, I'll use **React**.

## TODO

    - Project Set up
    - Add some functionnal analysis
